## 🚀 Project Overview

**Customer churn** refers to when customers stop doing business with a company. Reducing churn is vital for businesses to retain revenue and improve services. This project:
- Analyzes customer behavior data.
- Applies data preprocessing & feature engineering.
- Implements classification models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
- Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Identifies top features contributing to churn.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains **demographic**, **account**, and **usage data** of telecom users, with a `Churn` column as the target.

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| gender | Customer gender |
| tenure | Duration of service |
| MonthlyCharges | Monthly bill |
| TotalCharges | Lifetime bill amount |
| InternetService | Type of internet |
| ... | and more |
